Values members of the Red community should aspire to when communicating within the community:

* Be friendly and welcoming
* Be patient
    * Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)
* Be thoughtful
    * Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
    * Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
* Be respectful
    * In particular, respect differences of opinion. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.
* Avoid destructive behavior
    * Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation. Respect the room's topic.
    * Unconstructive criticism: don't merely decry the current state of affairs; offer (or at least solicit) suggestions as to how things may be improved.
    * Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments).

The following actions are explicitly forbidden:

* Insulting, demeaning, hateful, or threatening remarks.
* Discrimination based on age, disability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.
* Bullying or systematic harassment.
* Unwelcome sexual advances.
* Incitement to any of these.

The Red communication channels are moderated, disrespectful behavior will lead to exclusion from the communication channel.
